Zhong Chen's research focuses on developing stylized game-theoretical models to address problems in Operations Management (OM). His work spans various topics, including the intersection of OM with Marketing and Finance (e.g., retail channel co-opetition, innovative funding methods), operations of multi-sided platforms, and sustainability issues such as safety in agricultural supply chains and the deterrence of counterfeiting. Additionally, Zhong is interested in conducting empirical analyses on business panel data to validate the findings of these theoretical models.

Before joining UESTC, Zhong worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Zhejiang University and served as an assistant professor at East China Normal University. His research has been published in leading journals, including *Manufacturing and Servicing Operations Management*, *Production and Operations Management*, *European Journal of Operational Research*, and *Omega*.
